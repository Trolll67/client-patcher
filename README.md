# Patch Loader and Server

## Overview

This repository contains two scripts designed to manage and serve software patches efficiently:

1. **`loader.py`**: Implements the logic for downloading all patches starting from a specified version (`curr_patch_version`) up to the latest available version.
2. **`server.py`**: A simple HTTP server that serves the downloaded patches to clients.

## Setup

### Creating a Virtual Environment
To ensure a clean Python environment for this project, it is recommended to create a virtual environment:

1. Create the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
    ```bash
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install flask asyncio aiohttp aiofiles
    ```

## Usage

### `loader.py`
- Functionality: Downloads patches sequentially from the given `curr_patch_version` to the latest version.
- Configuration: Update the `curr_patch_version` parameter to the desired starting version.
- Execution: Run the script to automatically fetch all missing patches.

### `server.py`
- Functionality: Serves the patches via an HTTP server for client requests.
- Setup: Place the downloaded patches in the appropriate directory for the server to access.
- Execution: Start the server to allow clients to fetch the required patches.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
